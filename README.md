This project is based on [Gallery](https://github.com/blueimp/Gallery).


The invoked API which provides urls of pictures is in this project [R-Gallery](https://github.com/biaobiaoqi/R-Gallery). I used [grape](https://github.com/intridea/grape) to implement this independent API.

In the future, I'd like to combine these two projects to build a more common  gallery project.
